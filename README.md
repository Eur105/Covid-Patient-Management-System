# Covid-Patient-Management-System

This C++ application is designed to manage hospital records of COVID patients using object-oriented programming principles. Each patient has a secure profile with a username and password, allowing them to update personal details, view their vaccination status (including vaccine type, number of doses, and dates), check COVID test results, and track upcoming test schedules. Doctors have separate login credentials to securely access patient records while maintaining confidentiality, along with access to their professional information. The application also features a signup option for new patients, enabling them to create profiles via an online form. Additionally, a billing module generates invoices for hospital services, including masks, vaccines, and COVID tests. This project demonstrates my expertise in developing secure, structured, and user-friendly healthcare management systems in C++.

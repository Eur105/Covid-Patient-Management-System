# Covid-Patient-Management-System
This C++ application is designed to manage hospital records of COVID patients using object-oriented programming principles. Each patient has a secure profile with a username and password, allowing them to update personal details, view their vaccination status (including vaccine type, number of doses, and dates), check COVID test results etc.
